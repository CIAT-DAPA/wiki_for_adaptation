                What is the difference between an Indicator and a Metric?
                <i class="fa fa-chevron-down text-gray-400 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform"></i>
            </summary>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">An Indicator represents broad climate system changes or phenomena (e.g., Sea Level Rise), while a Metric is a specific quantitative measure used to track that indicator (e.g., Global Mean Sea Level measured in millimeters). One indicator can have multiple metrics measuring different aspects of the same phenomenon.</p>

                What are Methods and how do they relate to Metrics?
                <i class="fa fa-chevron-down text-gray-400 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform"></i>
            </summary>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">Methods describe different approaches or techniques for measuring a metric. Each metric can have multiple methods, each with its own advantages, limitations, and use cases. Methods help you choose the most appropriate measurement approach for your specific context.</p>

                What are SOPs and why are they important?
                <i class="fa fa-chevron-down text-gray-400 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform"></i>
            </summary>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are specific data products with detailed technical specifications for data collection and analysis. They ensure consistency and reproducibility in climate measurements across different projects and organizations. Each SOP provides specifications like units, frequency, geographic scale, and technical capacity requirements.</p>

            </summary>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">The wiki follows a three-level hierarchy: Indicators (broad phenomena) → Metrics (specific measures) → SOPs (data products). This structure helps you navigate from general concepts to specific implementation details, making it easy to find both high-level information and technical specifications.</p>
